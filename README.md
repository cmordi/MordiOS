# MordiOS


Do you like the name?! Modest. I know. This may not be the best operating system, but it is AN operating system. 

Why was this built? Who knows, the question you should be asking is WHY NOT! 

For my own sanity the kernel is mostly written in C and assembly, and not some obscure language. (*cough cough Perl...)

I will try to work on MordiOS as frequently as I can but you can count on the following features being integrated if they haven't already: 

## Features(current and upcoming)
- BIOS bootloader with 16-bit real mode and 32-bit protected mode debugging display routines in assembler.
- C or CPP kernel
- CPU model detection
- A decently sized libc (this is subjective I guess)
- Integrated QEMU emulation

will update if I implement more features...
